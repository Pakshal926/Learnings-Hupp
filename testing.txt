Things to Keep in Mind Before Sending Code for Q/A:

1. Test from the Frontend (if possible):
   Ensure that the code behaves as expected from the frontend interface to catch potential issues early.

2. Prepare a List of Required Fields:
   Identify and document all the necessary fields beforehand to avoid missing any key input during development.

3. Ensure Code Completeness:
   Double-check for missing logic, incomplete functions, or placeholder comments before submission.

4. Follow Project Guidelines:
   Ensure the code adheres to the project's naming conventions, file structures, and formatting rules.

5. Review for Errors or Warnings:
   Run the code locally to detect and fix any obvious bugs or console warnings before submitting.

6. Add Basic Documentation:
   Include minimal comments or notes to explain complex parts of the code for easier understanding by reviewers.
